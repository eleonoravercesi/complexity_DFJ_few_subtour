# On the complexity of the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson TSP formulation for few subtour constraints

This is GitHub repository accompaining the paper "On the complexity of the Dantzig-Fulkerson-Johnson TSP formulation for few subtour constraints", submitted to Informs Journal on Computing and currently available as a preprint on Optimization Online.

The folder contains the following files:

- `tsplib_hardtsplib.ipynb`  for reproducing the results of Table 1 and 2.
- `random.ipynb` for the results of Figure 3 and 5. 
- `plot.ipynb` for the results of Figure 4.
- `utils.py` containing the functions used in the notebooks, that can be of independent interest.

To run the notebook, first put in the folder `data` and put there the instances of the [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/) [1] and the [HardTSPLIB](https://github.com/eleonoravercesi/HardTSPLIB/) [2].
